# Introduction
This September, we are pleased to introduce Qwen-Image-Edit-2509, the monthly iteration of Qwen-Image-Edit. To experience the latest model, please visit [Qwen Chat](https://qwen.ai)  and select the "Image Editing" feature.
Compared with Qwen-Image-Edit released in August, the main improvements of Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 include:
* **Multi-image Editing Support**: For multi-image inputs, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 builds upon the Qwen-Image-Edit architecture and is further trained via image concatenation to enable multi-image editing. It supports various combinations such as "person + person," "person + product," and "person + scene." Optimal performance is currently achieved with 1 to 3 input images.
* **Enhanced Single-image Consistency**: For single-image inputs, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 significantly improves editing consistency, specifically in the following areas:
  - **Improved Person Editing Consistency**: Better preservation of facial identity, supporting various portrait styles and pose transformations;
  - **Improved Product Editing Consistency**: Better preservation of product identity, supporting product poster editingÔºõ
  - **Improved Text Editing Consistency**: In addition to modifying text content, it also supports editing text fonts, colors, and materialsÔºõ
* **Native Support for ControlNet**: Including depth maps, edge maps, keypoint maps, and more.


## Quick Start

Install the latest version of diffusers
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use `Qwen-Image-Edit-2509`:

```python
import os
import torch
from PIL import Image
from diffusers import QwenImageEditPlusPipeline

pipeline = QwenImageEditPlusPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
print("pipeline loaded")

pipeline.to('cuda')
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)
image1 = Image.open("input1.png")
image2 = Image.open("input2.png")
prompt = "The magician bear is on the left, the alchemist bear is on the right, facing each other in the central park square."
inputs = {
    "image": [image1, image2],
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 40,
    "guidance_scale": 1.0,
    "num_images_per_prompt": 1,
}
with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit_plus.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit_plus.png"))

```

## Showcase

**The primary update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is support for multi-image inputs.**

Let‚Äôs first look at a "person + person" example:  
![Person + Person Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8719.JPG#center)

Here is a "person + scene" example:  
![Person + Scene Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8720.JPG#center)

Below is a "person + object" example:  
![Person + Object Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8721.JPG#center)

In fact, multi-image input also supports commonly used ControlNet keypoint maps‚Äîfor example, changing a person‚Äôs pose:  
![ControlNet Keypoint Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8722.JPG#center)

Similarly, the following examples demonstrate results using three input images:  
![Three Images Example 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8723.JPG#center)  
![Three Images Example 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8724.JPG#center)  
![Three Images Example 3](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8725.JPG#center)

**Another major update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is enhanced consistency.**

First, regarding person consistency, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 shows significant improvement over Qwen-Image-Edit. Below are examples generating various portrait styles:  
![Portrait Styles Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%871.JPG#center)

For instance, changing a person‚Äôs pose while maintaining excellent identity consistency:  
![Pose Change with Identity Consistency](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%872.JPG#center)

Leveraging this improvement along with Qwen-Image‚Äôs unique text rendering capability, we find that Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 excels at creating meme images:  
![Meme Image Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%873.JPG#center)

Of course, even with longer text, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 can still render it while preserving the person‚Äôs identity:  
![Long Text with Identity Preservation](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%874.JPG#center)

Person consistency is also evident in old photo restoration. Below are two examples:  
![Old Photo Restoration 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8717.JPG#center)  
![Old Photo Restoration 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8718.JPG#center)

Naturally, besides real people, generating cartoon characters and cultural creations is also possible:  
![Cartoon & Cultural Creation](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8715.JPG#center)

Second, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 specifically enhances product consistency. We find that the model can naturally generate product posters from plain-background product images:  
![Product Poster Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%875.JPG#center)

Or even simple logos:  
![Logo Generation Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8716.JPG#center)

Third, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 specifically enhances text consistency and supports editing font type, font color, and font material:  
![Text Font Type](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8710.JPG#center)  
![Text Font Color](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8711.JPG#center)  
![Text Font Material](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8712.JPG#center)

Moreover, the ability for precise text editing has been significantly enhanced:  
![Precise Text Editing 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8713.JPG#center)  
![Precise Text Editing 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%8714.JPG#center)

It is worth noting that text editing can often be seamlessly integrated with image editing‚Äîfor example, in this poster editing case:  
![Integrated Text & Image Editing](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%876.JPG#center)

**The final update in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 is native support for commonly used ControlNet image conditions, such as keypoint control and sketches:**  
![Keypoint Control Example](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%877.JPG#center)  
![Sketch Control Example 1](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%878.JPG#center)  
![Sketch Control Example 2](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit2509/%E5%B9%BB%E7%81%AF%E7%89%879.JPG#center)
